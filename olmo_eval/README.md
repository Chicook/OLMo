# OLMo evaluation

## Downstream task evaluation during pretraining

This contains basic plumbing to hook OLMo into catwalk, using code currently 
available at https://github.com/OyvindTafjord/catwalk. Best used by running
beaker-gantry from within the catwalk repo, pointing to an appropriate beaker image.
